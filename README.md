## Moralis Project Boilerplate

### Overview

For this repo, I wanted to understand the mechanics of how to connect a dApp to a metamask chrome extension. Once having the connection of the application id and the server, you will then be able to connect the wallet correctly. Both credentials are provided from Moralis.io SDK dashboard.

Also I was able to find the VSCode extension for code snippets: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MoralisWeb3.moralis-snippets
